In the seven large cities with this policy, households cannot purchase cars freely, but must first win an auction or lottery. In this paper, we examine how the policy of vehicle ownership restrictions affects China’s new car sales, its fuel consumption, and its greenhouse gas emissions. We first examine the effects of vehicle ownership restrictions on China’s aggregate car sales. Utilizing transaction-level sales data of all new car sales in China between 2010 and 2015, we observe large discontinuities in the sales of new vehicles. We find that vehicle ownership restrictions reduced new car sales by 9.2% in China in 2015, a reduction of 1.86 million vehicles not purchased per year.\nWe then turn to the effects of vehicle ownership restrictions on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. To estimate the distance driven by car, we utilize a survey which asks new car buyers how many kilometers they traveled by car in each city. To estimate fuel economy, we examine the fuel economy of all new car purchases over our 2010 to 2015 time period. After performing a make-model match of sales to vehicle characteristics, we find that fuel economy in new cars sales improved by 3.6% over this time period.\nBecause of China’s market size and the magnitudes of cuts initiated by these ownership restriction policies, we find they have had global significance in terms of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\n","date":1580482524,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580482524,"objectID":"082a214f1aeaf6e3e4fb60ace5b9760c","permalink":"https://arthurlinku.github.io/project/the-effect-of-vehicle-ownership-restrictions-on-chinas-car-sales-fuel-consumption-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T09:55:24-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/the-effect-of-vehicle-ownership-restrictions-on-chinas-car-sales-fuel-consumption-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions/","section":"project","summary":"China’s cities have grappled with notorious problems of congestion and air pollution by using vehicle ownership restrictions.

Rational-choice economists question the counting of these beneﬁts since studies show that the fuel efﬁciency of a car is reﬂected in its price at sale and resale. We contribute to this debate by exploring why most consumers in the United States do not purchase a proven fuel-saving innovation: the hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV). A database of 110 vehicle pairs is assembled where a consumer can choose a hybrid or gasoline version of virtually the same vehicle. Few choose the HEV. A total cost of ownership model is used to estimate payback periods for the price premiums associated with the HEV choice. In a majority of cases, a rational-choice explanation is sufﬁcient to understand consumer disinterest in the HEV. However, in a signiﬁcant minority of cases, a rational-choice explanation is not readily apparent, even when non-pecuniary attributes (e.g., performance and cargo space) are considered. Future research should examine, from a behavioral economics perspective, why consumers do not choose HEVs when pricing and payback periods appear to be favorable.","tags":[],"title":"Most Consumers Dont Buy Hybrids Is Rational Choice a Sufficient Explanation","type":"publication"}]
