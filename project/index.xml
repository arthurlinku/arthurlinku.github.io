      <description>Increasing car emission contributes to air pollution in Chinese cities, and emission standards are adopted in cities to improve air quality. However, as the emission policies are usually adopted in metropolitans with regional influences, regions around these metropolitans may react the new emission regulations with more sales in older models. This study intends to evaluate the spillover effect of emission standards.</description>
