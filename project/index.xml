      <description>China’s cities have grappled with notorious problems of congestion and air pollution by using vehicle ownership restrictions. In the seven large cities with this policy, households cannot purchase cars freely, but must first win an auction or lottery. In this paper, we examine how the policy of vehicle ownership restrictions affects China’s new car sales, its fuel consumption, and its greenhouse gas emissions. We first examine the effects of vehicle ownership restrictions on China’s aggregate car sales.</description>

      <description>Increasing car emission contributes to air pollution in Chinese cities, and emission standards are adopted in cities to improve air quality. However, as the emission policies are usually adopted in metropolitans with regional influences, regions around these metropolitans may react the new emission regulations with more sales in older models. This study intends to evaluate the spillover effect of emission standards.</description>
